## Function: GetTitles (POST)

```uri
http://localhost/COS221-Practical-5-Group-23/api/GetTitle.php
```

### Description

This function handles a POST request to retrieve details about movies or TV shows and can also be used to filter titles based on a few criteria such as ***duration if it is a movie***   accepting a few parameters. if you give a duration search/constraint you can immediately assume it's a movie or if you give a season search/constraint you can immediately assume it's a TV show. 

Note: that duration is in minutes so it's an integer and release_date is the year of release so it's also an integer.

### Parameters (if a parameter has an asterisk{*} next to it, it means this key is required)

- *`return` (string || Array<string>): The string `"*"` is used to return all results or an array containing the items to return. The array should only contain any of the following:  
  
  `['list.media_ID', 'title, 'release_Date', 'description', 'content_rating', 'rating', 'poster_Url', 'Genre', 'CAST', 'DIRECTOR', 'WRITER', 'duration', 'seasons']`
  
  Note: "list.media_ID" refers to the media id of the title, and all these strings should be as is, as they are case sensitive but the order of how they are stored in the array is not important.

- *`limit` (int):  A number between 1 and 100 indicating how many results should be returned. 
  
  Note: PHP does not support the async function (I could've looked up how to do it but nako‚è≥) so making a request with a limit of 100  will be at the cost of your own time, I suggest keeping the limit $[1,30]$.

- `sort`(string): The results can be sorted by any of the following attributes: `['media_ID', 'title, 'release_Date', 'description', 'content_rating', 'rating', 'poster_Url', 'Genre', 'CAST', 'DIRECTOR', 'WRITER', 'duration', 'seasons']`
  
  - `order` (string): The results can be ordered by "ASC" or "DESC" for ascending or descending respectively.
    
    Note: the reason the order is indented into sort is that if you have a sort you ***MUST***  an order otherwise a bad request(400) will be returned. And you cannot have an order by itself.

- `search`(JSON): An object where the keys are columns of the data and the values are the search terms. Columns can be any of the following: `['type', 'title, 'release_Date', 'id', 'genre', 'rating', 'poster_Url', 'Genre', 'CAST', 'DIRECTOR', 'WRITER', 'duration', 'seasons']`
  
  - `type` (string): This is the type of content that should be searched for, it strictly has to be "tvshow" or "movie";
  
  - `title` (int): The title of the movie that you'd like to search for;
  
  - `id` (int): the id/media_id of the content you'd like to search for;
  
  - `genre` (string): The title that you would like filtered by the genre that's associated
  
  - `rating` (int): Titles with a specific rating $[1,5]$;
  
  - `content_rating` (string): Title with a specific content rating out of the following: `['PG', 'PG 9', 'PG 13', '16' or '18']`
  
  - `release_date` (int): The year in which a title is released.
  
  - `cast` (string): Retrieves the title based on the name of the cast member, you can enter either a first name or a last name to search for the title associated with the desired cast member.
  
  - `director` (string): Retrieves the title based on the name of the director, you can enter either a first name or a last name to search for the title associated with the desired director.
  
  - `writer` (string): Retrieves titles based on the name of the writer, you can enter either a first name or a last name to search for the title associated with the desired writer.
  
  - `minduration` (int): Retrieves titles based on if their duration is greater than or equal to minduration  $[minduration,\infty]$
  
  - `maxduration` (int): Retrieves titles based on if their duration is less than or equal to maxduration $[0,maxduration]$
  
  - `minseasons` (int): Retrieves titles based on if the number of seasons is greater than or equal to minseasons $[minseasons,\infty]$
  
  - `maxseasons` (int): Retrieves titles based on if the number of seasons is less than or equal to maxseasons $[0,maxseasons]$
    
    Note: You cannot search for "type":"movie" and also have a `maxseasons` or `minseasons` and also for "type":"tvshow"" you can't have a `minduration` or a `maxduration` as this will through a bad request(400) cause that's what distinguishes a movie from a tv show. but you can have a duration or a season search if you do have the opposing type or do not have a type search at all and this will still be valid.
  
  - `minrating` (int): Retrieves titles based on if their ratings are greater than or equal to minrating $[minrating,5]$
  
  - `maxrating` (int): Retrieves titles based on if their ratings are less than or equal to maxrating $[0,maxrating]$
  
  - `minreleasedate` (int): Retrieves titles based on if their release date is later than or equal to minreleasedate $[minreleasedate,\infty]$
  
  - `maxreleasedate` Retrieves titles based on if their release date is earlier than or equal to maxreleasedate $[0,maxreleasedate]$
    
    Note: when it comes to filtering using `min-` and `max-` and they relate such as `minduration` and `maxduration` in the same request it will limit the domain from being $\infty$ for min and being $0$ max and will instead be a domain of $[minduration,maxduration]$.
